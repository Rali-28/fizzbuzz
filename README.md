Practice problem solving skills through FizzBuzz.

FizzBuzz is usually used in coding interviews to test 
the skills of the interviewee. Basically the program must change value of numbers depending on their divisibility. Print "Fizz" if value is divisible by three. Print "Buzz" if value is divisible by 5. And "FizzBuzz" if divisible by 3 and 5.

Remember the three steps in Problem Solving:
* Understand the Problem
* Plan / Pseudo Code
* Divide and conquer
