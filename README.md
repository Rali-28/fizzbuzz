# fizzbuzz

Practice problem solving skills through FizzBuzz.

FizzBuzz is usually used in coding interviews to test 
the skills of the interviewee. Basically the program must change value of numbers depending on their divisibility. Print "Fizz" if value is divisible by three. Print "Buzz" if value is divisible by 5. And "FizzBuzz" if divisible by 3 and 5.

Remember the three steps in Problem Solving:
* Understand the Problem
* Plan / Pseudo Code
* Divide and conquer

### Pseudo Code

Loop of 1 - 100 numbers

    if divisible by 3 && 5
        replace value to
        print Fizz Buzz
    
    if divisible by only 3
        replace value to
        print Fizz

    if divisible by only 5
        replace value to
        print Buzz

    else 
        simply print the number
